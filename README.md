### Title: Training and Evaluating Xception Model

### Purpose:
This notebook is focused on building and evaluating an image classification model using the Xception architecture, which is a deep convolutional neural network developed by Google.

### Key Components:

*   Imports: It brings in various tools from TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

*   Model Building Tools: Imports layers, models, optimizers, losses, and utilities from keras, indicating that it will likely define and train a model.

*   Image Preprocessing: Includes tools for loading and preparing images using tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image.

So this notebook is primarily for training a model from scratch using the Xception architecture and evaluating its performance

### Purpose:
This notebook seems focused on loading a pre-trained model and making predictions on a test dataset.

### Key Components:

*  Model Loading: Uses model_from_json to load a saved Keras model architecture.

*  Evaluation Tools: Imports from sklearn.metrics to calculate precision, recall, F1-score, and classification report.

*  Image Preprocessing and Prediction: Loads test images using ImageDataGenerator and prepares the test dataset.

So this notebook is primarily for loading a trained model and running predictions on a test set to evaluate performance.
