### Title: Training and Evaluating Xception Model

### Purpose:
This notebook is focused on building and evaluating an image classification model using the Xception architecture, which is a deep convolutional neural network developed by Google.

### Key Components:

*   Imports: It brings in various tools from TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

*   Model Building Tools: Imports layers, models, optimizers, losses, and utilities from keras, indicating that it will likely define and train a model.

*   Image Preprocessing: Includes tools for loading and preparing images using tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image.

So this notebook is primarily for training a model from scratch using the Xception architecture and evaluating its performance
